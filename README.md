# Brewin Interpreter

An interpreter is a program that directly executes instructions written in a specific programming or scripting language, without first compiling them into machine code. This is an interpreter written in Python for a language called Brewin which is a mixture of C++, Python, and even EMACS Lisp.
Brewin can be tested here:

It uses a generated Abstract Syntax Tree or AST that holds the Brewin program's function(s), statements, and expressions. Then by parsing the AST, it is able to interpret assignments, object creation, prototypal inheritance, and more.
